# Around Me

What if you search for all the interesting data around you in an intuitive and friendly user interface?\
What if you check the schedules of your favorite transport mode without leaving your application?\
What if you combine all of these features with other modules to get itinerary directions?\

Interesting, right?
Well, `Around Me` module does that and a lot more ðŸ˜‰
